### Structuring Your Uploads ###
Please try to limit your number of individual uploads to the absolute minimum required. Especially if you want to publish the data in a manuscript, having it all referenced by a single hash will be preferable. Keep in mind every file in a directory upload can be accessed individually with a hash.

Uploads can be structured in any manner that you would like; however, in order to facilitate locating the exact information you are looking for, it is recommended that an upload is structured in a manner similar to the following: Create a readme file to be placed in the folder with the data to be uploaded. This file would contain information regarding who you are, and information as to what the rest of the uploaded folder contains. Within this main folder it is recommended that subdirectories be created for peak lists, spectra, or for any other images/annotations that you would like to publish.


### Making Encrypted Uploads Public ###
Currently, making a data set public can only be done through [Proteome Commons](https://proteomecommons.org).

  1. Sign in
  1. Navigate to your **My Data** page (**Data** > **My Data**)
  1. Click on the title of the data set you want to make public. This will take you to the data page.
  1. In the left menu, click the link **Make Public**


### Annotating Uploads ###
Annotations are a separate system from Tranche, and are accessible through [Proteome Commons](https://proteomecommons.org).

  1. Sign in
  1. Navigate to your **My Data** page (**Data** > **My Data**)
  1. Click on the title of the data set you want to annotate. This will take you to the data page.
  1. In the left menu, click the link **Annotate**.


### Finding/Searching Uploads ###
  * You can browse or search data sets on [Proteome Commons](https://proteomecommons.org). This will only show the visible data sets.
  * You can launch the Tranche GUI and browse the data sets from the tool as long as the data sets are visible.
  * You can launch the Tranche GUI and use the Tranche hash to download or look at the data set. This option is the only way to access private data sets, which is why it is important to save your upload hash or receipt. Also, if the data set is encrypted, you will need the passphrase.
